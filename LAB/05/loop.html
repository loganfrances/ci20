		//repeat as long as () is true

		// that's an infinite loop
		//problem: we need a boolean statement that is true for some of the time, eventually becomes false

		var counter = 0;			//1 - create a variable
		while (counter < 10){		//2 - set conditions for when the loop exits
			console.log("hi");
			counter = counter + 1;	//3 - how the loop changes
		}

		console.log("last line");


		// this for statement is the same as writing the 3 lines of code at the top, but much faster
		for (var counter = 0; counter < 10; counter = counter + 1){
			console.log("for loop");
